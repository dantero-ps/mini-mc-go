# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-08)

**Core value:** Infinite, beautiful worlds that are fun to explore
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - 3D Terrain Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 11 (3D Terrain Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-08 — Roadmap created with 11 phases covering all 60 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: N/A
- Trend: N/A (no completed plans yet)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Custom noise implementation — Full determinism control for world generation
- 2D heightmap (current) — Will be replaced in Phase 1 with 3D density system
- Greedy meshing — Proven performant for voxel rendering
- Chunk-based world — Foundation supports infinite streaming world

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Known from codebase analysis:**
- 2D heightmap limits terrain variety — ADDRESSED by Phase 1 focus
- No biome system — ADDRESSED in Phase 2
- Missing world persistence — ADDRESSED in Phase 10
- Performance at high render distances — ADDRESSED in Phase 9
